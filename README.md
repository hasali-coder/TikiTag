# TikiTag

TikiTag is a mobile-first event sharing platform that lets users create events, invite guests, collect RSVPs, and unlock a shared photo gallery exclusively for attendeesâ€”on the day of the event. Designed to preserve authenticity and connection, only those who RSVP can contribute and view moments from the occasion.
